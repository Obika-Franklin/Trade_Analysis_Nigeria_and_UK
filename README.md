In this project, I performed an in-depth analysis of international trade data, leveraging Python’s pandas library to uncover significant trade patterns, identify key partners, and reveal seasonal trends. The primary objective was to demonstrate how data analysis techniques, such as data cleaning and transformation, grouping and aggregation, and pivot tables, could be applied to complex trade datasets to derive meaningful insights.

The data for this study was sourced from the United Nations Comtrade Database, a comprehensive repository of international trade statistics. I focused on two distinct trade scenarios:

* **Nigeria’s Cocoa Trade (2023):** Analyzing import and export flows for cocoa beans (commodity code 1801) and cocoa shells, husks, and waste (commodity code 1802).
* **United Kingdom’s Milk Trade (2014):** Examining trade activities for milk and cream products (commodity code 0402).

Through this analysis, I addressed key questions related to trade balances, major trading partners, consistent trade relationships, and the temporal dynamics of these important commodity markets.
